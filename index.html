                <h2 id="headline">Here's a timeline of J Dilla's life:</h2>
                <ul id="timeline">
                    <li><strong>1974</strong> - <b>James Yancey</b> is born on February 7 in Detroit, Michigan from <b>Maureen "Ma Dukes" Yancey</b>, a former opera singer and <b>Beverly Dewitt Yance</b>y, a jazz bassist</li>
                    <li><strong>1992</strong> - Yancey meets Detroit musician <b>Amp Fiddler</b>, who let him use his Akai MPC, a music workstation, which he quickly mastered.</li>
                    <li><strong>1995</strong> - Yancey and <b>MC Phat Kat</b> form 1st Down and become the first Detroit hip hop group to sign with a major label</li>
                    <li><strong>1996</strong> - He forms <b>Slum Village</b> and recorded what would become their debut album Fantastic, Vol. 1 at RJ Rice Studios. Upon its release, the album quickly became popular with fans of Detroit hip hop. Many journalists compared Slum Village to A Tribe Called Quest. However, Yancey said he felt uncomfortable with the comparison and often voiced it in several interviews.</li>
                    <li><strong>1997</strong> - Yancey had a string of singles and remix projects for artists such as
                        <b>Janet Jackson</b>, <b>The Pharcyde</b>, <b>De La Soul</b>, <b>Busta Rhymes</b>, <b>A Tribe
                            Called Quest</b>, <b>Q-Tip</b>'s solo album and others. Many of these productions were released without his name recognition, being credited to
                        <b>the Ummah</b>, a production collective composed of him, <b>Q-Tip</b> and <b>Ali Shaheed
                            Muhammad</b> of A Tribe Called Quest, and later <b>Raphael Saadiq</b> of Tony! Toni! Toné!. However, he was given songwriting credit on all of his non-remix productions under the Ummah.</li>
                    <li><strong>2000</strong> - Major label debut of Slum Village with Fantastic, Vol. 2, creating a new following for Yancey as a producer and an MC. He was also a founding member of the production collective known as
                        <b>The Soulquarians</b> (along with Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson, D'Angelo and James Poyser amongst others) which earned him more recognition. He later worked with
                        <b>Erykah Badu</b>, <b>Poe</b>, <b>Talib Kweli</b>, and <b>Common</b>—contributing heavily to the latter's critically acclaimed breakthrough album, Like
                        <b>Water for Chocolate</b>.</li>
                    <li><strong>2001</strong> - His debut as a solo artist with the single <b>"Fuck the Police"</b>, followed by the album Welcome 2 Detroit, which began British independent record label BBE's "Beat Generation" series. In 2001, Yancey began using the name
                        <b>J Dilla</b> to differentiate himself from <b>Jermaine Dupri</b> who also goes by "J.D." He left Slum Village to pursue a major label solo career with MCA Records.</li>
                    <li><strong>2002</strong> - The Los Angeles producer and <b>MC Madlib</b> began collaborating with Yancey, and the pair formed the group
                        <b>Jaylib</b>, releasing an album called Champion Sound in 2003. Yancey relocated from Detroit to Los Angeles in 2004 and appeared on tour with Jaylib in Spring 2004.</li>
                    <li><strong>2006</strong> - Yancey died on February 10, 2006, at his home in Los Angeles, three days after his 32nd birthday and the release of his final album, Donuts. Maureen said that the cause was cardiac arrest. Despite a slower output of major releases and production credits in 2004 and 2005, his cult status remained strong within his core audience, as evidenced by unauthorized circulation of his underground "beat tapes" (instrumental, and raw working materials), mostly through internet file sharing.</li>

                    <p>"One of the things Dilla wanted me to do with his legacy was to use it to help others, people with illness, kids
                        who were musically gifted but had little hope due to poverty. I wanted to use my contacts to help people out and
                        it was squashed because we weren't in compliance with the state and there was nothing we could do about it. I'm
                        Dilla's mother and I can't use Dilla's name or likeness, but I know that I still can honor him by doing his work."
